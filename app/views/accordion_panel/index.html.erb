<% title "Netzke::AccordionPanel" %>

Features:
<li>Dynamically loads the nested widget when a panel gets expanded for the first time</li>
<li>Is loaded along with the "active" widget - saves a request to the server</li>

<h2>Example: two GridPanels loaded dynamically</h2>
<p>A two-panel accordion, where panels, at the moment of being expanded, dynamically load two differently configured GridPanels.</p>

<h2>Example: a Panel and a BorderLayoutPanel, where the former is active</h2>
